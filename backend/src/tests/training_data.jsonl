This is based on things you will\nexperience frequently in your committees. This will also test your ability to execute\nhigh quality deliverables \u2014 similar to what your members will be creating.\n\nTake at most 30 minutes on each assessment. Write on a separate google doc and\ndownload as a PDF. Remember, you only need to complete the one based on your\ntop-choice role.\n\nReview Roles here:\n\nDesign-a-thon: Leadership Role Descriptions\n\nOperations\nScenario: Two days before the event, you learn that several key volunteers will not\nbe able to attend due to unforeseen circumstances. You must quickly \ufb01nd\nreplacements and ensure they are properly onboarded and trained to keep the\nevent running smoothly.\n\nAssessment Task:\n\n\u25cf Develop an Action Plan: Outline a plan to recruit and onboard new\n\nvolunteers.

(10\nminutes)\n\n\fDesign\nScenario: You are designing the theme for design-a-thon this year, but you are\ngetting a lot of con\ufb02icting opinions from your team on what they want to see. How\nwould you resolve this?\n\nAssessment Task:\n\n\u25cf Explain Your Design Process: Outline your approach to getting stakeholder\n\nbuy-in while still developing a strong visual brand. Include steps for\nbrainstorming, concept development, design execution, and \ufb01nal review.\nProvide a brief timeframe for each step. (15 minutes)\n\n\u25cf Alignment: Write a brief explanation of how the new design aligns with the\nevent's updated theme and how it will appeal to the target audience. (5\nminutes)\n\n\u25cf Design Style: Add some samples of your previous designs (graphic design,\nwebsite designs, etc) relevant to this role. Brie\ufb02y describe your style (10\nminutes)\n\nCorporate\nScenario: One of your major sponsors has just informed you that they will have to\nreduce their \ufb01nancial support by half due to unforeseen circumstances. You need to\nsecure additional funding or resources to ensure the event can proceed as planned.\n\nAssessment Task:\n\n\u25cf Draft an email to potential sponsors explaining the situation and proposing a\nnew partnership opportunity.

For each channel,\nprovide speci\ufb01c tactics and a timeline for implementation. (20 minutes)\n\u25cf Draft a social media post (lay out the vision for the graphic and write the\ndescription for the post) that can be used to attract more participants,\nfocusing on the unique aspects of our event. (10 minutes)\n\nFinance\nScenario: You\u2019ve just realized that the current budget plan has underestimated the\ncost of several key items, putting the event at risk of running over budget.\n\nAssessment Task:\n\n\u25cf Fund Allocation Plan: Given a hypothetical amount of $10,000 in\n\nsponsorship funds, allocate these funds across key budget items (e.g., venue,\ncatering, AV equipment, prizes). Justify your allocation decisions and ensure\nall critical areas are covered. (20 minutes)\n\n\u25cf Review the budget allocation spreadsheet from last year (attached below)\nand identify any discrepancies, errors, or confusing elements.

General background: Just this in design, you should understand the context\n\nof who this is being shipped to.\n\na. Target audience: assume that everyone reading your handbook is a\nbeginner. This means that you want to limit the jargon and make the\n\n\fcontent as accessible and approachable as possible for any\nparticipant.\n\nb. Format: pdf document (though make it printable) that will be shipped\n\nthrough email and on the website for clients. In other words, the\ndocument should include links that users can interact with.\n2. Write table of contents: includes all the core contents you will cover. At the\n\nbare minimum, this must include:\n* note that everything here should be introductory, ie: beginner friendly\n\na.

Think of how you will organize a magazine, a\nsimilar process follows with this handbook.\n\na. Possibility 1) Fully text-based handbook: This will look something like\n\nthis. Use a google document to lay out each\n\nb. Possibility 2) With visuals: This will look something like this. Use\n\ncanvas or a similar platform to lay this out.\n\n4. Creating the Content: research and write out the content you want for each\n\nsection. Some things to keep in mind:\n\na. Keep it modular: there shouldn't be big chunks of content. Bullet\n\npoints and short, bite-sized, and to-the-point pieces of content are\npreferred.\nInclude visuals: give examples through images\n\nb.\nc. Make it actionable: your content should include links and step by step\n\ntutorials for people to immediately take action.\n\nExamples and Resources\nUse these as references for what your handbook can look like!\n\n\u25cf https://designcode.io/ux-design-handbook\n\u25cf gen she promotion guide - good setup/layout of handbook\n\u25cf Davis Fest Design-a-thon resources\n\nPlaces to Research\nSome of the sections such as design process and the technicals on how to use\n\ufb01gma and create wireframes may require more research.
